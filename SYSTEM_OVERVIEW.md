# Recognition System - Complete Overview

## What is this system?

The **ESE Recognition System** is a comprehensive employee evaluation and recognition platform designed for Educational School of Excellence (ESE). It streamlines the performance review process and facilitates staff appreciation through a digital, role-based system.

## Core Purpose

This system serves two main functions:
1. **Performance Evaluations** - Structured, multi-perspective employee assessments
2. **Recognition & Nominations** - Peer-to-peer and formal appreciation programs

## System Architecture

### Authentication & Security
- **Secure Login**: Uses ESE email + Oasis ID combination

- **Data Persistence**: All evaluations and nominations stored securely using the Spark KV system

### User Roles & Permissions

## Workflow Examples

### Performance Evaluation Cycle
1. **Admin Setup**: Configure evaluation periods and assign participants
2. **Self-Assessment**: Employees complete their self-evaluations (5% weight)
3. **Peer Reviews**: Colleagues provide anonymous feedback (10% weight each)
4. **Supervisor Review**: Direct managers evaluate subordinates (30-40% weight)
5. **Leadership Input**: CEO and P&C Head provide strategic perspective (15-25% weight)

The following matrices clarify how leadership weighting splits differ for administrative versus academic staff cohorts:

| Administrative Track Rater | Weight | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Department Head (Operations) | 40% | Primary supervisor evaluation anchored to operational KPIs. |
| Division Director / Principal | 20% | Secondary leadership layer to balance cross-campus oversight. |
| P&C Head | 15% | Ensures HR alignment with organizational culture and policy compliance. |
| CEO | 10% | Strategic leadership calibration for executive staff. |
| Peer (Cross-Function) | 10% | Optional peer insight from adjacent administrative teams. |
| Self-Assessment | 5% | Required reflective input captured during setup. |

> **Weight validation**: Administrative totals reach 100% only when the optional peer review is included; omit it to rebalance other levers proportionally inside the scheduler presets.

| Academic Track Rater | Weight | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Department Head (Instruction) | 40% | Core instructional supervisor ensuring curriculum fidelity. |
| Principal | 15% | Campus-level leadership perspective for classroom impact. |
| P&C Head | 10% | Human capital lens for faculty development and retention planning. |
| CEO | 10% | Strategic alignment with institutional goals. |
| Peer Teachers (2 × 10%) | 20% | Aggregated peer observations to promote collaborative growth. |
| Self-Assessment | 5% | Baseline reflective practice for educators. |

> **Weight validation**: Academic totals sum to 100%, enabling direct import into Automation Center templates without additional normalization.
6. **AI Analysis**: System processes all inputs and identifies trends
7. **Results Generation**: Final scores calculated with weighted averages
8. **Admin Review**: Leadership accesses comprehensive results and analytics

Both tracks follow the biannual cadence outlined in the [Multi-Rater Evaluation System schedule](PRD.md#multi-rater-evaluation-system), locking primary performance reviews to December and March. Probationary hires inherit the next scheduled window, with any interim 90-day check-ins configured through the [Automation Center](#-automation-center) UI or via the [Automated Task Scheduler API presets](PRD.md#automated-task-scheduler).
