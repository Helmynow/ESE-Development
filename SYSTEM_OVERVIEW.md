# Recognition System - Complete Overview

## What is this system?

The **ESE Recognition System** is a comprehensive employee evaluation and recognition platform designed for Educational School of Excellence (ESE). It streamlines the performance review process and facilitates staff appreciation through a digital, role-based system.

## Core Purpose

This system serves two main functions:
1. **Performance Evaluations** - Structured, multi-perspective employee assessments
2. **Recognition & Nominations** - Peer-to-peer and formal appreciation programs

## System Architecture

### Authentication & Security

- **Data Persistence**: All evaluations and nominations stored securely using the Spark KV system

### User Roles & Permissions

#### üî¥ Admin Level (CEO & P&C Head)
- **Full System Access**: Can view and participate in all evaluations
- **Results Access**: Only admins can see final evaluation results and analytics
