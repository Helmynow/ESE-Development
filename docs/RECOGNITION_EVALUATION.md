# Recognition & Evaluation System

## Overview

The Recognition & Evaluation System is a comprehensive platform for managing employee performance evaluations and recognition programs at ESE (Educational School of Excellence). This system implements structured, fair, and transparent processes for:

1. **Multi-Rater Evaluation (MRE)** - 360-degree performance assessments
2. **Employee of the Month (EOM)** - Monthly recognition program
3. **Employee of the Year (EOY)** - Annual recognition based on cumulative performance

## Multi-Rater Evaluation (MRE) System

### Purpose

The MRE system provides comprehensive performance assessments through weighted multi-perspective feedback, ensuring fair and balanced evaluations aligned with ESE's values of transparency and professional excellence.

### Evaluation Cycles

- **Primary Cycles**: December and March
- **Duration**: 2-3 weeks per cycle
- **Manual Initiation**: Authorized by CEO or P&C Head

### Weighted Scoring System

The MRE system uses differentiated weights based on evaluator roles to ensure balanced assessment:

#### Academic Staff Evaluation Weights

| Evaluator Role | Weight | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Self-Assessment | 5% | Employee's own performance reflection |
| Peer Review | 10% each | Colleagues in same department (max 2 peers) |
| Supervisor (Principal/Coordinator) | 30-40% | Direct manager evaluation |
| CEO | 15% | Leadership strategic perspective |
| P&C Head | 25% | HR and organizational culture assessment |

**Total**: 100% (5% self + 20% peers + 30-40% supervisor + 15% CEO + 25% P&C)

#### Administrative Staff Evaluation Weights

| Evaluator Role | Weight | Description |
|---------------|--------|-------------|
| Self-Assessment | 5% | Employee's own performance reflection |

   - Supervisors complete evaluations (30-40% weight)
   - Leadership provides strategic input (CEO 15%, P&C 25%)

3. **Processing Phase**
   - AI analysis identifies patterns and trends
   - Weighted averages calculated automatically
   - Results compiled with comprehensive feedback

4. **Review Phase**
   - Admin reviews aggregated results
   - Identifies performance outliers
   - Prepares developmental recommendations

5. **Distribution Phase**
   - Results shared with employees
   - One-on-one feedback sessions scheduled
   - Development plans created

### Fairness and Compliance Controls

- **Anonymous Peer Reviews**: Ensures honest feedback without fear of reprisal
- **Weighted Scoring**: Prevents single-source bias
- **AI-Powered Variance Detection**: Identifies unusual scoring patterns
- **Audit Trail**: All evaluations logged with timestamps and evaluator IDs
- **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions prevent unauthorized viewing

### Variance Alerting

The system monitors for evaluation anomalies:

- **High Variance**: Score spread >3 points across evaluators
- **Outlier Detection**: Individual scores >2 standard deviations from mean
- **Incomplete Submissions**: Missing evaluations flagged for follow-up
- **Deadline Tracking**: Automated reminders for pending evaluations

Variance alerts trigger:
1. Notification to P&C Head
2. Review by evaluation coordinator
3. Optional request for clarification from evaluators
4. Escalation to CEO if unresolved
