### Variance Detection and Alerting

#### Statistical Variance Monitoring
The system calculates variance across all evaluators for each evaluee:

```
Variance = Σ(score - mean)² / (n - 1)
```

#### Variance Thresholds
- **Low Variance**: σ < 1.5 (normal, expected)
- **Moderate Variance**: 1.5 ≤ σ < 2.5 (review recommended)
- **High Variance**: σ ≥ 2.5 (requires investigation)

#### Outlier Detection
Individual evaluator scores flagged as outliers if:
- >2 standard deviations from mean
- Consistently higher/lower than peers
- Pattern of extreme scores (all 1s or all 10s)

### Variance Alert Workflow

#### Step 1: Automatic Detection
- System calculates variance after each submission
- Flags evaluations exceeding thresholds
- Generates alert report
- Notifies P&C Head

#### Step 2: Initial Review (P&C Head)
- Reviews variance report
- Examines individual scores
- Checks for obvious errors
- Identifies outlier evaluators

#### Step 3: Contextual Analysis
- Consider evaluator relationships
- Review historical evaluation patterns
- Check for possible bias indicators
- Assess feedback quality

#### Step 4: Follow-Up Actions
**For Moderate Variance (1.5 ≤ σ < 2.5):**
- Monitor for pattern in next cycle
- Note in evaluation records
- No immediate action required
- Include in quarterly review

**For High Variance (σ ≥ 2.5):**
- Contact outlier evaluators for clarification
- Request additional context
- Verify scores are intentional
- Document explanations

**For Critical Outliers:**
- CEO and P&C Head joint review
- Interview evaluators if necessary
- Consider score adjustment if error confirmed
- Provide evaluator training if bias detected

#### Step 5: Documentation
- Record all variance investigations
- Document follow-up actions
- Note evaluator responses
- Update training needs

#### Step 6: Resolution
- Mark alert as resolved
- Implement any corrective measures
- Update evaluation if justified
- Close case with summary
